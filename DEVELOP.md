# Developing the Yor action

The action is largely following Github recommandations and examples.
Most notably those two guides:

 - [Developing a third party CLI action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/developing-a-third-party-cli-action)
 - [Create a JavaScript Action using TypeScript](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action)

Github action expects code to be compiled and committed.
Make sure you run `npm run all` before committing, the CI will check it.
